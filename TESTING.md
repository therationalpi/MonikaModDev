# Testing Flow / Bug Testing
This is a separate section from the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines) page. It will contain a small guide on testing things you wish to implement for bugs & other issues, which is crucial to do before submitting a Pull Request to the repository. 

## Setting Up
### The Tools
Can't work without tools, right? Here's a list of simple but effective tools you can use for testing & fixing bugs. 

#### Text Editors
[Atom](https://atom.io/) - One of the most prominent text editors used by MAS contributors, *Atom* has many tools & features that allow for efficient and clean work on files that are being edited. It even has tools for *fixing merge conflicts.*

[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Lightweight and takes only a few minutes to install. Highly recommended for dialogue writing.
