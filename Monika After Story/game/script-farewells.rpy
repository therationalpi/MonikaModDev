##This file contains all of the variations of goodbye that monika can give.
## This also contains a store with a utility function to select an appropriate
## farewell
#
# HOW FAREWELLS USE EVENTS:
#   unlocked - determines if the farewell can actually be shown
#   random - True means the farewell is shown in the randomly selected
#       goodbye option
#   pool - True means the farewell is shown in the goodbye list. Prompt
#       is used in this case.
