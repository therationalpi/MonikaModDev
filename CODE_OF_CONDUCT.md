# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Contributing Rules

- All contributions get reviewed and discussed by the Dev team.
- Contributors and other members can leave reviews but these will only be considered suggestions and should be treated as such.
- When a Dev team member asks you to make changes to your pull request, you should make the requested changes to your pull request.
- If you disagree with the requested change you can comment on your pull request stating clearly why you don’t agree with the requested change. Don’t forget to adhere to our code of conduct when doing so. Please provide valid and objective reasons. Also remember that the reviewer has the final decision on this.
- Please avoid trying to do "workarounds" when a Dev asks you to make changes. An example of this would be instead of modifying an specific line of dialogue like requested, you make two lines and just make the selection between them random.
- The Dev team can make edits to the contributions to their discretion if the author doesn’t respond to a review after 15 days.
- All the discussions on a pull request/issue must be on-topic, whenever a thread starts getting off-topic or the posts there don’t comply with our code of conduct the thread will be locked at our staff’s discretion.
- Please be patient and act according to our code of conduct, none of the Devs nor the contributors earn anything from this "for love" project, so no one is willing to work with someone who is disrespectful.
- If a contribution requires some advanced coding that the contributor can't make by themselves, the Dev team will add those to the contribution. 
- The Dev team reserves the right to approve or reject contributions at their own discretion.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at monikaaftermod@gmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
